# What are the differences between “git commit” and “git push”?

-> Basically git commit "records changes to the repository" while git push "updates remote refs along with associated objects". So the first one is used in connection with your local repository, while the latter one is used to interact with a remote repository.

-> In simple words , we can say that git commit puts your changes into your local repo, while git push sends your changes to the remote location.
