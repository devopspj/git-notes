If a commit message contains unclear, incorrect, or sensitive information, you can amend it locally and push a new commit with a new message to GitHub. You can also change a commit message to add missing information.

->Rewriting the most recent commit message
-> You can change the most recent commit message using the :

git commit --amend command.

-> In Git, the text of the commit message is part of the commit. Changing the commit message will change the commit ID--i.e., the SHA1 checksum that names the commit. Effectively, you are creating a new commit that replaces the old one.
