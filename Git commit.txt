Few Points about Git commit command :

-> git commit commits the staged snapshot to the project history.

-> "git commit" command only saves a new commit object in the local Git repository.

Important Options
-m <message>

-> Sets the commit's message. 
-> Make sure to provide a concise description that helps your teammates (and yourself) understand what happened.

$ git commit -m "Change titles and styling on homepage"


-a

-> Includes all currently changed files in this commit. Keep in mind, however, that untracked (new) files are not included.

$ git commit -a -m "Change titles and styling on homepage"


--amend

-> Rewrites the very last commit with any currently staged changes and/or a new commit message. 
-> Git will rewrite the last commit and effectively replace it with the amended one. 
-> Note that such a rewriting of commits should only be performed on commits that have not been pushed to a remote repository, yet.

$ git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
